                Phenomenal… Have to say that I have not had such a great experience in a long time. Attentive staff, great food and drinks. And from a freshness standpoint, the sushi was amazing. I have not had such quality sushi in a long time. Our waiter was on it the entire time will be requesting him again in the future. We definitely will be back.
